Forked from [https://github.com/O-R-G/pps_master](https://github.com/O-R-G/pps_master) which was originally developed for International Center of Photography Museum opening to work together with [https://github.com/O-R-G/pps_clock](https://github.com/O-R-G/pps_clock).

This discrete macOS .app runs in a titlebar-less window anchored to the top left of the desktop as a desk accessory of sorts, particularly when running Finder with automatic hide/show menu bar in macOS 10.12 and later.
